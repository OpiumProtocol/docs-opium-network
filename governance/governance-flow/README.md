# Governance flow

A typical proposal lifecycle from inception to execution looks as follows:

* **Discussion:** a participant comes up with a proposal, discusses it with other Opium community members, collects feedback, analyzes all pros and cons
* **Compromise:** the discussion is finalized when a compromise is reached
* **Voting:** the same or other participant makes a proposal on a signalling vote to decide if the proposal will be implemented or not. Community members have at least 48 hours to vote  on the proposal
* **Execution:** If the proposal passes, blockchain executes the proposal automatically. Otherwise, or invalid transaction appears
