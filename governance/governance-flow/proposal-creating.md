# Proposal creating

### Discussion

First, create a discussion on the [Opium Governance Forum](https://forum.opium.network) in one of the following sections:

* Governance
* Learn about&#x20;
* Opium Build on Opium&#x20;
* Bounties and contests&#x20;
* Other&#x20;

Try to stay objective and list all pros and cons of your proposal, so every community member can make up their mind about the initiative. However, you can explain and advocate for  your point of view freely in the comments.&#x20;

The author of the discussion is responsible for the flow of the discussion: keep it up-to-date, so every person new to  the discussion wonâ€™t need to scroll through all the comments and can easily see the updates in the main post.

The discussion is finalized when a compromise is reached.&#x20;

### Making the proposal

Making the proposal is the final step before actual voting. The proposal with the clear points that can be voted on with a simple Yes (Agree) or No (Disagree). If the proposal implies some actions add a batch of transactions while creating a voting proposal.

### Voting

The voting period must be set to at least 48 hours, so community members will have the opportunity  to evaluate the initiative make up their minds and vote on it. However, for urgent matters this requirement can be dropped.

Opium  token holders receive voting power proportionally to the number of their governance tokens on balance.&#x20;

### **Execution**

After the off-chain voting is over, the result is sent to Reality.eth to record on-chain whether it passed or failed. If a proposal passes, the initiative is auto-executed, if it fails, blockchain marks it as an invalid transaction. For a visual representation of the process see the picture below.

If you suspect a malicious action, freeze a proposal and send it for arbitration. Opium Aragon DAO is set as an arbitrator, which allows $OPIUM token holders to decide the outcomes of the proposals using on-chain voting in case of disputes or attacks.
