# OracleAggregator

It is the data layer of the Opium Protocol.

&#x20;The OracleAggregator is the contract responsible for providing the necessary data to settle a financial product in the Opium Protocol.&#x20;

It does not implement any specific oracle logic as it is designed to be more oracle-agnostic. This grants developers the freedom to choose the data source of their application - be it any oracle of their choosing or an off-chain API.
