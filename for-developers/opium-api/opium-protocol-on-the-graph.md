# Opium Protocol on The Graph

We implemented GraphQL subgraph with realtime data from [**Opium Protocol**](https://opium.network/) ****to make our systems more robust and reliable. Also, it helps developers to easily understand Opium Protocol and integrate it into their projects.

The Graph team pinned our subgraph to the main page of the explorer.

Check out ****[**Mainnet**](https://thegraph.com/explorer/subgraph/opiumprotocol/opium-network) and [**Rinkeby**](https://thegraph.com/explorer/subgraph/opiumprotocol/opium-network-rinkeby) ****subgraphs of Opium Protocol.
