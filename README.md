# Opium Documentation

### The goal &#x20;

The goal of this documentation is to provide a comprehensive overview of the project for current and future contributors within a formalized path to the full decentralization of the Opium Protocol. As the founding team takes a step back, leaving the government power to the community, it is crucial to have a single point of truth for all stakeholders to refer to. The documentation is published on GitHub and is open for contributions to reflect the growth and development of the project. This current document is the result of work of many contributors, many thanks to all contributors and special thanks for Stani, Kain, Anton, Sergej, Synth and for your contribution, support and endless community calls.

### The scope&#x20;

This Documentation explains:&#x20;

* what the Opium protocol is&#x20;
* how it works with actual examples&#x20;
* how a user without any coding knowledge can interact with it and how a developer can build something on top of the protocol or modify it&#x20;
* what efforts are in place to guarantee the security, including the list of past security audits and the bug bounty program&#x20;
* how to contribute to the development of the Opium protocol with or without tech experience and&#x20;
* how to participate in the grant programs.&#x20;
* A substantial part of the documentation covers the governance processes from discussion of the proposals and voting procedures to the actual execution as well as how $OPIUM tokens can be used and what $OPIUM token holders can vote on.

### **Disclaimer – please read before getting to the next section**

**Opium provides innovative, cutting-edge technology that is yet to be proved by time. As a beta version of a new financial system, the Opium protocol serves primarily the community of experienced DeFi professionals, who are able to evaluate associated risks, including, but not limited to, the technical failure and permanent capital loss. It’s essential to understand that the parallel with traditional financial tools such as derivatives is drawn solely for a simplified explanation of Opium’s possibilities. Despite seeming similarity, DeFi tools are quite different, with their unique costs and benefits, risks and protection mechanisms. The Opium protocol provides software that enables and enforces transactions between two or more parties without a traditional centralized intermediary. Please make sure you fully understand how this software operates, the incentive mechanism that it employs, implications of technical failure and other protocol-specific risks before using any of the Opium products.**
