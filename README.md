# Opium Documentation

### Disclaimer

**It is extremely important and crucial to read DISCLAIMER and understand the following: decentralized protocols are very new and innovative attempts to build new types of financial primitives. However those protocols are mostly in the Beta version, run by enthusiasts and they require basic understanding of assumptions and terms. Simple terms like “call options” are only used to illustrate the logic behind new financial primitives comparing them to analogies from the financial system. For example “call option” on decentralized protocol may be a financial primitive that behaves like a “call option spread” most of the time, but have some crucial differences in terms of counterparty risk \(managed by blockchain\), settlement asset, technological risks and underlying asset.**
