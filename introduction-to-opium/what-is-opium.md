# What is Opium

The Opium protocol is a universal protocol to create, settle and trade virtually all derivatives and financial instruments in a professional and trustless way. It allows anyone to build custom exchange-traded products on top of the EVM-Compatible blockchains. Once created, they can be traded freely via a network of relayers and will be priced according to supply and demand.  
  
The Opium Network is a learning ecosystem that can work with the custom logic of both derivatives and oracles. All created positions are represented by ERC-721o tokens that are specially designed for trading financial instruments and can be combined into portfolios and natively traded in combined orders. At the same time, these tokens are backward compatible with the ERC-721 token standard and can be used in existing ecosystems. 

Opium introduces “Turing complete derivatives” \(both exchange-traded and over-the-counter\) and “Turing complete oracles”. This combination allows creating contracts in a broader scope than just financial derivatives. A contract for any event, such as a sporting event or even a lottery, can be set up - all within the existing ecosystem. Because derivatives can be combined, it opens a huge number of use cases.

This site will serve as a project overview for the Opium Network - explaining how it works, how to use it, and how to build on top of it.
